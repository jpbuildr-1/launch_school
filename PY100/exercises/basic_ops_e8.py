# To what value does the following expression evaluate?
'12' < '9'
# this evaluates to True because
# the 1st character on the left side of 
# the expression 1 is compared to 
# the 1st and only character on the right
# side of the expression 9 and 1 is less
# than 9. The expression does not consider
# the 2nd character of '12' when evaluating
# the expression.
